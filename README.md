## 🚀 Problem Statement

Government and enterprise procurement processes suffer from severe operational inefficiencies:

- **Massive volumes** of unstructured bid documents (PDFs, scans, spreadsheets)
- **Multi-stage manual verification** processes taking weeks or months
- **High dependency** on external consultants for evaluation
- **Risk of human error, bias, and delays** in vendor selection
- **Lack of transparency** in reasoning behind vendor scoring
- **No unified view** for objective comparison across vendors

Traditional tender evaluation is slow, opaque, and resource-intensive. Evaluating a single tender often takes weeks with significant consultant costs and potential for inconsistent decision-making.
